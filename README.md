# Elixir Beer Song
Sing a song counting bottles from 99 to 1, until they run out

## Recite the lyrics to that beloved classic, 
## that field-trip favorite: 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

...

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
